# 🪷 Claw Code — Phase 1–4: ANALYZE → PLAN → VALIDATE → IMPLEMENT

## Executive Summary

The user has given explicit approval to proceed ("awesome meticulous job, keep up the good work"), treating the prior architecture review as the VALIDATE checkpoint. This task is a **pure documentation artifact** — no code risk, maximum value. I will now produce the **definitive Project Architecture Document** for Stillwater, designed to serve as the single source of truth for the entire engineering lifecycle: onboarding, implementation, code review, and long-term maintenance.

**What I will deliver:**
A production-grade `PAD.md` (Project Architecture Document) that is:
- Exhaustive without being verbose — every section earns its presence
- Visually structured with Mermaid diagrams, tables, and decision records
- Actionable — engineers can open this and immediately understand what to build and why
- Living-document-ready — version-controlled, with ADR entries and changelog

### How to Maintain This Document

- All **structural** changes (new service, new data entity, new integration) **require a PAD update** before merging the implementing PR.
- All **architectural decisions** must be logged in [Section 29: ADRs](#29-architecture-decision-records).
- This document lives at the repository root: `/PAD.md`.
- Diagrams are written in Mermaid and render natively in GitHub and most modern IDEs.

## 1. Executive Summary

**Stillwater** is a full-stack, enterprise-grade yoga studio management platform. It serves as both the **public marketing surface** for the studio and a **complete operational platform** for members, instructors, and studio staff.

The system enables:

- **Members** to browse the class schedule, book sessions, manage their membership subscription, join waitlists, and track their attendance history.
- **Instructors** to view their teaching schedule, manage availability, and access class rosters.
- **Studio Staff & Owners** to manage the full class catalog, instructor roster, member accounts, revenue reporting, and studio settings.
- **Content Editors** to update marketing copy, blog posts, instructor bios, and pricing information independently of the engineering team via a headless CMS.

### Guiding Principle

> *Build the platform a boutique wellness studio deserves — not the one a SaaS template provides.*

This means: production-grade reliability, an editorial-quality public surface, and operational tooling that reduces friction for every stakeholder.

---

## 2. Project Vision & Goals

### 2.1 Vision Statement

Stillwater is the operational backbone and digital face of the studio — a platform that reflects the calm intentionality of the practice it serves, while running with the reliability and scalability of enterprise software.

### 2.2 Goals

| # | Goal | Success Metric |
|---|------|----------------|
| G1 | Members can self-serve all booking needs | Zero booking-related support tickets per week |
| G2 | Studio owner can update schedule without engineer involvement | Schedule changes live in < 5 minutes via admin UI |
| G3 | Marketing content updates require zero deployments | Content editor publishes via Sanity; ISR propagates in < 5 min |
| G4 | Platform handles 500 concurrent users without degradation | p95 response time < 200ms at 500 RPS |
| G5 | Payment processing is reliable and auditable | Zero unreconciled transactions; full Stripe webhook audit log |
| G6 | Accessibility is not an afterthought | **Lighthouse Accessibility score: 100 (automated baseline) + quarterly manual screen-reader & keyboard audit (WCAG 2.2 Level AAA target).** Lighthouse wraps axe-core which catches only ~30–57% of WCAG issues; a perfect 100 does NOT equal WCAG compliance. Source: `PAD_audit_report-1.md` §"Lighthouse 100 + WCAG AAA" + Deque Systems axe-core coverage stats. |
| G7 | Engineers can onboard in < 1 day | New dev runs `pnpm dev` successfully within 30 minutes |

### 2.3 Non-Goals (Explicit Scope Exclusions)

- **No native mobile app** — the web application is fully responsive and PWA-capable.
- **No video streaming infrastructure** — virtual class links are external (Zoom/Google Meet URLs stored in the DB).
- **No marketplace / multi-studio support** — this is a single-studio platform; multi-tenancy is not in scope for v1.
- **No AI/ML features** — recommendation engines, personalization, and predictive analytics are future scope.
- **No POS integration** — in-person payments are handled externally; the platform manages online memberships only.

### 4.3 Architecture Pillars

| Pillar | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Type Safety** | End-to-end TypeScript strict mode + tRPC | Eliminates runtime type errors across the entire stack |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Domain-grouped route groups, package-per-concern | Prevents feature coupling; enables team scaling |
| **Content Independence** | Sanity CMS for all marketing content | Studio owner changes schedule/copy without a PR |
| **Resilient Payments** | Stripe Billing + idempotent webhooks | No lost revenue from network failures or retries |
| **Async-First** | All side effects (email, notifications) via Trigger.dev | API responses stay fast; side effects are durable |
| **Edge Performance** | ISR + Cloudflare CDN + next/image | LCP < 1.5s on mobile, globally |
| **Security by Default** | RBAC at middleware + procedure level, Zod validation everywhere | Defense in depth; no implicit trust |

---

## 5. Technology Stack & Rationale

### 5.1 Full Stack Decision Matrix

| Layer | Technology | Version | Rationale | Rejected Alternatives |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | Next.js | `^16.2.0` | App Router, Turbopack stable, React Compiler (opt-in via `reactCompiler: true` — NOT default; requires `babel-plugin-react-compiler` devDependency installed separately), `proxy.ts` (replaces `middleware.ts` — can run on Edge or Node.js runtime; Next.js 16 docs are inconsistent on the default), streaming, ISR, top-level `cacheComponents: true` (moved out of `experimental` in Next.js 16); top-level `serverExternalPackages` (moved from `experimental` in Next.js 15, not 16) | Remix (less ecosystem), Nuxt (different team skills) |
| **UI Library** | React | `^19.2.3` | Concurrent features, `use()`, Server Components. ⚠️ **CVE-2025-55182 floor** ("React2Shell" RCE, CVSS 10.0) — never downgrade below 19.2.3. | — |
| **Language** | TypeScript | `^5.9.0` | Strict mode end-to-end; `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables`, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` (requires `import type`), `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` (FORBIDS `enum` and `namespace`) | — |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | `^4.3.0` | Utility-first, zero dead CSS in production, v4's CSS-first `@theme`, `@source` directives for monorepo content scanning; `outline-hidden` replaces v3 `outline-none` (v4 `outline-none` now sets `outline-style: none` — different semantics) | CSS Modules (verbose), styled-components (runtime cost) |
| **Component Primitives** | Radix UI | latest | Fully accessible, unstyled, composable | Headless UI (fewer components), Ark UI (less mature) |
| **API Layer** | tRPC | v11 | End-to-end type safety, no code generation, integrates natively with Next.js | REST (no type safety bridge), GraphQL (overkill, complex) |
| **ORM** | Drizzle ORM | `^0.45.0` | Type-safe SQL, zero magic, excellent PostgreSQL support, fast. `db.$count` requires ≥0.34; relational query API v1 (`db.query.*`) since 0.28; v2 (`defineRelations()`) requires ≥1.0.0-beta. | Prisma (slower, heavier, type gen required), Kysely (more verbose) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | 17 | Advisory locks for bookings, JSONB for metadata, proven at scale | MySQL (weaker advisory lock support), SQLite (not for prod) |
| **Database Host** | Neon | latest | Serverless PostgreSQL, branching for preview envs, zero cold starts | Supabase (more opinionated), RDS (heavy setup) |
| **Cache / Rate Limit** | Upstash Redis | latest | Serverless Redis, per-request billing, edge-compatible | Redis Cloud (needs VPC), Memcached (no sorted sets) |
| **Auth** | Better Auth | v1.6.23 | Type-safe, framework-agnostic, Drizzle adapter, magic link + OAuth, server-component native; stable v1.x line (Auth.js v5 still beta at 5.0.0-beta.31) | Auth.js v5 (still beta, maintenance handover to Better Auth team Sept 2025), Clerk (vendor lock-in, cost), NextAuth v4 (legacy) |
| **Background Jobs** | Trigger.dev | **v4** | Durable execution, retries, scheduling, excellent DX. **v3 is deprecated — new v3 deploys stop working April 1, 2026; v4 reached GA August 2025.** | Inngest (similar but fewer features), BullMQ (self-hosted complexity) |
| **CMS** | Sanity | v3 | GROQ queries, real-time collaborative editing, webhook-driven ISR | Contentful (expensive), Payload CMS (self-hosted complexity) |
| **Payments** | Stripe | `^22.3.0` | Industry standard, Billing API, webhooks, tax support. ⚠️ **"Dahlia" API (2026-06-24)** pinned by SDK v22; `current_period_end` moved to `items.data[0].current_period_end` (introduced in Basil 2025-03-31, carried forward). SDK exposes **snake_case** to match API wire format (NOT camelCase — use `current_period_end`, not `currentPeriodEnd`). | Paddle (US restrictions), Braintree (complex) |
| **Email Templates** | React Email | `^6.6.6` | JSX email templates, unified package (v6.0.0 paradigm shift April 16, 2026 — `@react-email/components` and `@react-email/render` deprecated, all imports from `react-email` root). ⚠️ v6 bundle is 1.8MB (514KB gzipped) — pulls `prismjs`, `marked`, `tailwindcss` compiler at runtime. See `react_email_suggestion.md` Alternative A (Resend Native Templates) to protect Trigger.dev CPU budgets. | MJML (XML, not TypeScript), Handlebars (no type safety) |
| **Email Delivery** | Resend | `^6.17.1` | Built for developers, React Email native integration, generous free tier (2,400 emails/day). Supports Resend Native Templates (template ID + variables API) as zero-runtime-rendering alternative to local JSX rendering — recommended for Trigger.dev workers to avoid 1.8MB React Email v6 bundle bloat. | SendGrid (complex API), Postmark (no React Email native) |
| **Monorepo** | Turborepo | `^2.10.0` | Incremental builds, task caching, excellent pnpm support; graceful shutdown + deferred input hashing (2.10+) | Nx (heavier), Lerna (legacy) |
| **Package Manager** | pnpm | `^11.0.0` | Workspace support, fast, disk-efficient. `custom-conditions=@stillwater/source` in `.npmrc`. pnpm 9.x is EOL — use 11.x+. | npm (slow workspaces), yarn (inconsistent behavior) |
| **Testing: Unit/Integration** | Vitest | latest | Fast, ESM native, compatible with Vite ecosystem | Jest (slower, ESM friction) |
| **Validation** | Zod | `^4.4.0` | Env module, Server Action inputs, tRPC procedure inputs. Zod v4 `z.string().url()` accepts any scheme → use `z.url({ protocol: /^https:$/ })` (v4 native) or `.refine()` for protocol restriction; enum errors use unified `{ error }` param (string or function) — `{ errorMap }` removed, `{ message }` deprecated; `z.ZodIssueCode` deprecated in v4 → use string literal `'custom'` in `ctx.addIssue()`. | yup (less TypeScript-native), Joi (older) |
| **Testing: E2E** | Playwright | latest | Cross-browser, reliable, component testing support | Cypress (slower, no Firefox) |
| **Analytics** | PostHog | latest | Self-hostable, GDPR-friendly, feature flags, funnels | Mixpanel (cost), Amplitude (cost), GA4 (privacy concerns) |
| **Logging** | Axiom | latest | Structured logs, fast queries, Next.js native integration | Datadog (cost), Papertrail (limited) |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | latest | Zero-config Next.js, edge network, preview deployments | Fly.io (more config), Railway (less edge) |
| **Image CDN** | Cloudflare Images | latest | Transforms on-the-fly, R2 storage, global CDN | Cloudinary (cost), imgix (cost) |
| **Uptime Monitoring** | Checkly | latest | Synthetic monitoring, E2E checks in production | Pingdom (no E2E), Better Uptime |
| **Linting** | ESLint | `^9.39.4` | v9 flat config (`tooling/eslint/index.js`). ⚠️ Do NOT upgrade to v10 — `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.5` and `eslint-plugin-import@2.32.0` have no v10-compatible versions (see MEP D45). v9.39.4 is the `maintenance` dist-tag (actively receiving security/bug fixes). | ESLint v10 (plugin ecosystem hasn't caught up); Biome (less mature plugin ecosystem) |

### 5.2 Node.js & Runtime Versions

```
Node.js:    >= 22.x LTS  (required for native fetch, ESM stability)
pnpm:       11.0.0       (workspace protocol support; pnpm 9.x is EOL — use 11.x+)
TypeScript: ^5.9.0       (const type parameters, inferred type predicates, `erasableSyntaxOnly`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`)
```

## 7. Data Architecture

### 7.1 Entity Relationship Diagram

> **Implementation Status:** ✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE (2026-07-07). All 14 entities below are implemented as Drizzle `pgTable` definitions in `packages/db/src/schema/`. The `members` table includes an additional `stripeCustomerId` column (D6 fix — not shown in ERD below) for Stripe webhook customer lookups. See `packages/db/src/schema/` for the canonical TypeScript definitions and `packages/db/drizzle/migrations/0000_chemical_obadiah_stane.sql` for the generated DDL.

### 7.2 Database Enums

```sql
-- Defined in packages/db/src/schema/enums.ts

CREATE TYPE class_level AS ENUM ('all', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced');
CREATE TYPE session_status AS ENUM ('scheduled', 'cancelled', 'completed', 'in_progress');
CREATE TYPE enrollment_status AS ENUM ('confirmed', 'cancelled', 'attended', 'no_show');
CREATE TYPE waitlist_status AS ENUM ('waiting', 'offered', 'accepted', 'expired', 'removed');
CREATE TYPE subscription_status AS ENUM ('active', 'paused', 'cancelled', 'past_due', 'trialing', 'incomplete');
CREATE TYPE billing_interval AS ENUM ('month', 'year');
CREATE TYPE studio_role AS ENUM ('member', 'instructor', 'staff', 'manager', 'owner');
CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'processed', 'failed', 'ignored');
```

### 7.3 Critical Index Strategy

```sql
-- Booking performance: fast seat count
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_session_status
  ON enrollments (session_id, status)
  WHERE status = 'confirmed';

-- Schedule queries: date range lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_starts_at_status
  ON class_sessions (starts_at, status)
  WHERE status = 'scheduled';

-- Waitlist ordering
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_session_position
  ON waitlist_entries (session_id, position)
  WHERE status = 'waiting';

-- Member subscription lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_member_status
  ON member_subscriptions (member_id, status)
  WHERE status = 'active';

-- Stripe event idempotency
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_payment_events_stripe_id
  ON payment_events (stripe_event_id);
```

### 7.4 Migration Strategy

```
Tool:     Drizzle Kit (drizzle-orm/kit)
Process:  drizzle-kit generate → review SQL → drizzle-kit migrate
Environments:
  - Local:      docker-compose postgres; pnpm db:migrate
  - Preview:    Neon branch per PR (auto-provisioned via Neon API in CI)
  - Production: Migration runs in deploy job, before new code serves traffic

Rules:
  - NEVER destructive migrations on production without a backup snapshot
  - All migrations are additive by default; deprecate columns before dropping
  - Column renames: add new column → backfill → migrate reads → drop old
  - Every migration PR requires a rollback script as a PR comment
```

## 8. API Architecture

> **Implementation Status:** ✅ Phase 3 COMPLETE (2026-07-07). 10 tRPC routers (~30 procedures) implemented in `packages/api/src/routers/`. 4 procedure access tiers (public/protected/staff/owner) in `packages/api/src/trpc.ts`. Booking router uses advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) per ADR-004. Rate limiting on `bookings.book` (10/min via Upstash). Root router merging all 10 routers in `packages/api/src/root.ts`. Web tRPC integration: HTTP handler (`/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`), RSC server caller (`lib/trpc/server.ts`), React client (`lib/trpc/client.tsx`), query key factory (`lib/trpc/query-keys.ts`). Phase 7 procedures (Stripe) stubbed with `PRECONDITION_FAILED`. 326 tests (104 api + 102 auth + 107 db + 13 web).

### 8.1 tRPC Design Principles

```
1. One router per domain entity (not per feature)
2. Procedures are named as verbs: get, list, create, update, delete, + domain-specific
3. All inputs validated with Zod at the procedure boundary
4. No raw DB queries in Next.js components — all data through tRPC
5. Server Components use the server-side tRPC caller (zero HTTP overhead)
6. Client Components use the tRPC React Query client for caching + optimistic updates
```

### 8.2 Router Map

```typescript
// packages/api/src/root.ts

export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  classes:       classesRouter,      // Class catalog CRUD
  sessions:      sessionsRouter,     // Class session management
  bookings:      bookingsRouter,     // Book, cancel, check-in
  waitlist:      waitlistRouter,     // Join, leave, status
  members:       membersRouter,      // Member profile, history
  instructors:   instructorsRouter,  // Instructor profiles
  memberships:   membershipsRouter,  // Plans, subscriptions
  payments:      paymentsRouter,     // Stripe portal, invoices
  schedule:      scheduleRouter,     // Public schedule queries
  admin:         adminRouter,        // Admin-only aggregations
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

### 8.3 Procedure Access Levels

```typescript
// packages/api/src/trpc.ts

// Three procedure tiers — not two:
export const publicProcedure    = t.procedure;
export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use(enforceIsAuthed);
export const staffProcedure     = t.procedure.use(enforceIsAuthed).use(enforceIsStaff);
export const ownerProcedure     = t.procedure.use(enforceIsAuthed).use(enforceIsOwner);
```

### 8.4 Procedure Catalog (Selected Critical Paths)

| Router | Procedure | Access | Method | Description |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| schedule | `getWeek` | public | query | Returns all sessions for a given ISO week |
| schedule | `getSession` | public | query | Single session with live enrollment count |
| bookings | `book` | protected | mutation | Book a session; auto-waitlists if full |
| bookings | `cancel` | protected | mutation | Cancel booking; triggers waitlist promotion |
| bookings | `checkIn` | staff | mutation | Staff check-in for member attendance |
| waitlist | `join` | protected | mutation | Add to waitlist |
| waitlist | `leave` | protected | mutation | Remove from waitlist |
| waitlist | `claimOffer` | protected | mutation | Accept promoted waitlist spot |
| members | `getProfile` | protected | query | Own member profile |
| members | `getHistory` | protected | query | Attendance + booking history |
| memberships | `getPlans` | public | query | Available membership plans |
| memberships | `subscribe` | protected | mutation | Start subscription via Stripe |
| memberships | `cancel` | protected | mutation | Cancel subscription at period end |
| memberships | `pause` | protected | mutation | Pause subscription |
| payments | `getPortalUrl` | protected | mutation | Stripe customer portal URL |
| payments | `getInvoices` | protected | query | Invoice history |
| admin | `getDashboard` | staff | query | KPI summary for admin home |
| admin | `getRevenue` | staff | query | MRR, churn, attendance metrics |
| admin | `getClassRoster` | staff | query | Session roster with check-in status |

### 8.5 tRPC Context Shape

```typescript
// packages/api/src/context.ts

export interface TRPCContext {
  db:      DrizzleDB;            // Database client
  session: Session | null;       // Better Auth session
  jobs:    TriggerClient;        // Background job client
  redis:   Redis;                // Upstash Redis client
  req:     Request;              // Raw request (for headers, IP)
}
```

## 9. Authentication & Authorization

> **Implementation Status:** ✅ Phase 2 COMPLETE (2026-07-07). Better Auth v1.6.23 fully configured in `packages/auth/src/config.ts` with Google OAuth + Magic Link plugin + customSession plugin (session enrichment with `memberId` + `roles`). 3 Better Auth schema tables (`session`, `account`, `verification`) in `packages/db/src/schema/auth-tables.ts`. RBAC permission matrix (13 × 6) in `packages/auth/src/rbac.ts`. Server-side auth helpers in `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`. 2-layer auth pattern: Layer 1 (proxy.ts, cookie-only) + Layer 2 (4 layout guards). `users.emailVerified` changed from `timestamp` to `boolean` per Better Auth requirement. Migration `0001_supreme_sabretooth.sql`. 220 tests (102 auth + 107 db + 11 web).

### 9.1 Authentication Flow

### 9.3 Session Token Shape

```typescript
// Extended by Better Auth session callback
interface StillwaterSession {
  user: {
    id:                  string;
    email:               string;
    name:                string | null;
    image:               string | null;
    memberId:            string | null;
    roles:               StudioRole[];
    activeSubscription:  ActiveSubscriptionSummary | null;
  };
  expires: string;
}
```

### 9.4 Middleware Route Protection

```typescript
// apps/web/proxy.ts (Next.js 16 — replaces middleware.ts per ADR-009)

const ROUTE_ROLE_MAP: Record<string, StudioRole[]> = {
  '/dashboard':        ['member', 'instructor', 'staff', 'manager', 'owner'],
  '/book':             ['member', 'instructor', 'staff', 'manager', 'owner'],
  '/admin':            ['staff', 'manager', 'owner'],
  '/admin/revenue':    ['manager', 'owner'],
  '/admin/settings':   ['owner'],
};

## 10. Frontend Architecture

### 10.1 Component Hierarchy

```
Page (Server Component — data fetching)
└── Layout Shell (Client — nav state, theme)
    └── Feature Section (Server Component)
        └── Interactive Widget (Client — 'use client' boundary)
            └── UI Primitive (Radix-based from packages/ui)
```

### 10.2 Data Fetching Patterns

| Context | Pattern | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Server Component (RSC) | `await serverCaller.schedule.getWeek()` | Zero HTTP round-trip; runs in same process |
| Client Component (initial) | tRPC useQuery with initialData from RSC | Hydrates instantly, then keeps fresh |
| Client Component (mutation) | tRPC useMutation + optimistic update | Instant UI feedback; server confirms asynchronously |
| Admin data tables | tRPC useQuery with React Query pagination | Server-side pagination; cache per page |
| Real-time seat count | SSE via `EventSource` hook | Push updates without polling |

### 10.3 State Management Philosophy

```
No global state manager (Redux, Zustand) is needed.

State lives at the appropriate layer:
  - Server state:        React Query (via tRPC)
  - URL state:           nuqs (type-safe search params)
  - Local UI state:      useState / useReducer
  - Form state:          react-hook-form + Zod resolver
  - Cross-component:     Zustand (ONLY if prop drilling exceeds 3 levels)

If you reach for Zustand for server data, you've made an error.
```

### 10.4 Form Architecture

```typescript
// All forms follow this pattern:
// 1. Define Zod schema (shared with tRPC input)
// 2. useForm with zodResolver
// 3. onSubmit calls tRPC mutation
// 4. Error boundary handles unexpected failures
// 5. Field-level errors from Zod, toast for server errors

const bookingSchema = z.object({
  sessionId: z.string().uuid(),
  notes:     z.string().max(500).optional(),
});

type BookingFormValues = z.infer<typeof bookingSchema>;
```

### 10.5 UI State Completeness Rule

**Every data-dependent UI must implement all four states:**

```
✅ Loading:  Skeleton components (not spinners for layout-defining content)
✅ Error:    Inline error with retry action + Sentry capture
✅ Empty:    Meaningful empty state with a clear call-to-action
✅ Success:  The actual content
```

## 11. Design System

### 11.1 Conceptual Direction

**"Editorial Calm"** — The intersection of high-end wellness editorial (Kinfolk / Monocle aesthetics) and Japanese spatial design philosophy (間, *ma* — negative space as active presence). Every design decision is intentional. Nothing decorative without structural purpose.

**Anti-Generic Enforcement Contract:**

```
BANNED:
  ✗ Purple-to-pink gradients on hero sections
  ✗ Inter/Roboto as the only typeface
  ✗ Drop shadows on cards as the primary depth signal
  ✗ "Book a Free Trial" CTAs in rounded pill buttons
  ✗ Stock photography of people meditating in beige rooms
  ✗ Predictable 3-column feature grids
  ✗ Sticky nav with logo left, links center, CTA right

REQUIRED:
  ✓ Typographic hierarchy as the primary structural tool
  ✓ Whitespace used as a luxury signal, not wasted space
  ✓ Asymmetric, editorial grid breaks that feel intentional
  ✓ Color temperature that changes how the user feels, not just what they see
  ✓ Micro-interactions earned through meaning, not decoration
```

### 11.2 Typography System

```css
/* Self-hosted fonts — zero FOUT with size-adjust */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond';
  src: url('/fonts/cormorant/CormorantGaramond-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
}

/* Scale: Display → Heading → Body → Caption */
--font-display:   'Cormorant Garamond', Georgia, serif;  /* Serenity, luxury */
--font-body:      'DM Sans', system-ui, sans-serif;       /* Clarity, function */
--font-mono:      'JetBrains Mono', 'Courier New', mono;   /* Data, precision */

/* Type Scale (fluid, clamp-based) */
--text-display-2xl: clamp(3.5rem, 8vw, 7rem);     /* Hero statements */
--text-display-xl:  clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4.5rem);   /* Section titles */
--text-display-lg:  clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3.25rem);    /* Page headings */
--text-heading-lg:  clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem);     /* Sub-headings */

--text-body-sm:     0.875rem;                      /* Captions, labels */
--text-caption:     0.75rem;                       /* Fine print */

/* Line Heights */

--max-width-narrow:    720px;   /* Editorial reading width */
--max-width-wide:      1440px;
```

### 11.5 Motion System

```css
/* Motion: purposeful, breath-like, never gratuitous */
--ease-gentle:  cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);     /* Expo out — snappy settle */
--ease-breathe: cubic-bezier(0.45, 0, 0.55, 1);    /* Sine in-out — organic */

--duration-quick:    150ms;   /* Hover states */
--duration-standard: 300ms;   /* Transitions */
--duration-slow:     600ms;   /* Page reveals */
--duration-crawl:    900ms;   /* Decorative/ambient */

/* Prefers-reduced-motion: respected globally */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### 11.6 Component Anatomy (Radix-Based)

All interactive components are built on **Radix UI primitives**, styled with Tailwind CSS using the design tokens above. No custom accessibility implementation from scratch.

```
packages/ui/src/components/
├── Button       — Radix Slot + cva variants (primary, ghost, outline, destructive)
├── Input        — Native input + label + error state; accessible by default
├── Select       — Radix Select; styled to match editorial direction
├── Dialog       — Radix Dialog; used for booking confirmation, cancellation
├── Popover      — Radix Popover; used for filter dropdowns
├── Calendar     — Radix (or react-day-picker); schedule date picker
├── Toast        — Radix Toast; global notification system (Sonner preferred)
├── Badge        — Enrollment status, class level, membership tier
├── Avatar       — Member/instructor avatar with fallback initials
├── DataTable    — TanStack Table + Radix; admin member/class lists
├── Skeleton     — Loading state system; matches exact layout of loaded state
└── ProgressBar  — Seat availability visual indicator

## 13. Real-Time Architecture

### 13.1 Use Case: Live Seat Availability

The booking page must show **accurate, live seat counts** to prevent optimistic overbooking and to build urgency ("2 spots left"). This uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** rather than WebSockets because:
- The data flow is **server → client only** (no client push needed)
- SSE works over standard HTTP/2; no separate WebSocket server
- Works natively on Vercel serverless with streaming responses

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant SSERoute as GET /api/schedule/stream
  participant DB as PostgreSQL

  Browser->>SSERoute: EventSource('/api/schedule/stream?sessionId=...')
  SSERoute-->>Browser: HTTP 200 (text/event-stream)
  SSERoute->>DB: SELECT count(*) FROM enrollments WHERE session_id = ?
  DB-->>SSERoute: count = 11
  SSERoute-->>Browser: data: {"available": 1, "total": 12}

  Note over SSERoute,DB: Polls every 10 seconds

  Browser->>SSERoute: (User books a spot — triggers mutation)
  SSERoute->>DB: SELECT count(*)
  DB-->>SSERoute: count = 12
  SSERoute-->>Browser: data: {"available": 0, "total": 12}
  Browser-->>Browser: Updates UI: "Class Full — Join Waitlist"
```

### 13.2 SSE Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// apps/web/app/api/schedule/stream/route.ts

export const runtime = 'nodejs';
// ⚠️ Do NOT set `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` — incompatible with `cacheComponents: true` (build error per Next.js 16). Route handlers that read `req.url` or stream are dynamic by default.

// ⚠️ Critical (audit-verified): Vercel serverless functions have a default timeout
// (10s Hobby, 15s Pro default) that will silently terminate this SSE stream.
// The stream polls every 10s indefinitely, so it WILL hit the default timeout.
// As of June 2026, Vercel allows up to 30 minutes (1800s) on Pro/Enterprise,
// but this requires BOTH `maxDuration` AND enabling Fluid Compute in project settings.
// Source: PAD_audit_report-1.md §"SSE on Vercel" + PAD_audit_report-2.md §A.
export const maxDuration = 300;  // 5 minutes — balances live-seat freshness vs connection cost
// For longer sessions, increase to 1800 (30 min) and ensure Fluid Compute is enabled.
// The client-side EventSource auto-reconnects on disconnect (ADR-006), so brief
// staleness during reconnection is acceptable.

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
  const sessionId = searchParams.get('sessionId');

  if (!sessionId) return new Response('Missing sessionId', { status: 400 });

  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  let intervalId: NodeJS.Timeout;

  const stream = new ReadableStream({

## 14. Content Management Architecture

### 14.1 Sanity CMS Content Models

```
Sanity Studio manages ONLY marketing content.
Operational data (classes, sessions, bookings) lives in PostgreSQL.

Sanity Content Types:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  siteSettings        — Studio name, address, hours, social links
  homePage            — Hero content, featured classes, testimonials
  aboutPage           — Studio story, values, team narrative
  blogPost            — Author, publishedAt, body (Portable Text), tags
  faq                 — Question + answer pairs, categorized
  instructorBio       — Extended bio, gallery (supplements DB record)
  testimonial         — Member quote, name, class, rating
  announcement        — Time-bound banner (e.g., "Studio closed Dec 25")
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 14.3 GROQ Query Patterns

```typescript
// packages/api (or apps/web/lib/sanity/queries.ts)

// Blog post with author — fetched at build time (ODR)
export const blogPostQuery = groq`
  *[_type == "blogPost" && slug.current == $slug][0] {
    title,
    publishedAt,
    "slug": slug.current,
    body,
    "author": author->{ name, image },
    "tags": tags[]->{ title, "slug": slug.current }
  }
`;

// Homepage content — ISR 1hr
export const homePageQuery = groq`
  *[_type == "homePage"][0] {
    hero { headline, subheadline, ctaLabel, ctaHref },
    "featuredClasses": featuredClasses[]->{ title, slug, description, level },
    testimonials[]{ quote, memberName, className, rating }
  }
`;

## 15. Payment Architecture

### 15.1 Stripe Entity Mapping

```
Stripe Object          ↔    Stillwater Concept
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Customer               ↔    Member (1:1, stored in members.stripeCustomerId)
Product                ↔    MembershipPlan.name
Price                  ↔    MembershipPlan.stripePriceId
Subscription           ↔    MemberSubscription.stripeSubscriptionId
Invoice                ↔    Monthly/annual billing record
PaymentIntent          ↔    ClassPackage purchase
Webhook Event          ↔    PaymentEvent (idempotent audit log)
```

### 15.2 Subscription Lifecycle State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Trialing: subscribe() with trial period
  [*] --> Active: subscribe() without trial

  Trialing --> Active: trial_will_end webhook → payment collected
  Trialing --> Cancelled: member cancels during trial

  Active --> PastDue: payment_failed webhook
  Active --> Paused: member requests pause
  Active --> Cancelled: cancel_at_period_end = true → period ends

  PastDue --> Active: payment recovered (invoice.paid)
  PastDue --> Cancelled: max retries exceeded

  Paused --> Active: pause_resumes_at reached OR member reactivates
  Paused --> Cancelled: member cancels while paused

  Cancelled --> [*]
```

### 15.3 Webhook Reliability Architecture

```
Problem:  Stripe webhooks can be retried. Processing an event twice must be safe.
Solution: Idempotency via PaymentEvent table + advisory lock.

Webhook Handler Flow:
1. Verify Stripe signature (stripe.webhooks.constructEvent)
2. Check payment_events table for stripe_event_id → if exists, return 200 (already processed)
3. Acquire `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hash(event.id))` → prevents concurrent processing of same event (transaction-scoped — auto-releases at COMMIT/ROLLBACK; **do NOT use session-scoped `pg_advisory_lock`** which breaks under Neon's PgBouncer transaction pooling and can leak)
4. Process event (update subscription status, provision credits, etc.)
5. Insert payment_events record with status = 'processed' — lock auto-releases at transaction COMMIT
6. Return 200

> ⚠️ **Critical (audit-verified):** The original draft of this section specified `pg_advisory_lock()` (session-scoped). Under Neon's managed PgBouncer (transaction pooling mode, the default), session-scoped locks are NOT guaranteed to release on the same backend that acquired them — this causes lock leaks and pool exhaustion. The booking flow (§4.2) correctly uses `pg_advisory_xact_lock()`; the webhook handler MUST use the same. Source: `PAD_audit_report-1.md` §"Advisory Lock Inconsistency" + `PAD_audit_report-2.md` §B + Neon FAQ on built-in connection pooling.

Events Handled:
  customer.subscription.created      → Create MemberSubscription record
  customer.subscription.updated      → Sync status, period dates
  customer.subscription.deleted      → Mark as cancelled
  invoice.paid                       → Credit member's monthly credits
  invoice.payment_failed             → Mark past_due, trigger retry email
  invoice.payment_action_required    → Send 3DS authentication email
  customer.subscription.trial_will_end → Send trial ending notification
```

### 15.4 Credit System

```
Members on a credit plan (e.g., "8 classes/month") receive credits:
  - At subscription creation (first period)
  - At each invoice.paid event (subsequent periods)
  - Credits do NOT roll over (expire at period end)
  - Credits are consumed at booking time (transactionally)
  - A credit ledger is maintained in class_packages for audit
```

## 16. Email Architecture

### 16.1 Email Template Catalog

| Template | Trigger | Subject Line |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `WelcomeMember` | User account created | "Welcome to Stillwater, {name}" |
| `BookingConfirmation` | Enrollment created | "You're booked: {class} on {date}" |
| `BookingCancellation` | Enrollment cancelled by member | "Booking cancelled — {class}" |
| `ClassCancellation` | Session cancelled by staff | "Class cancelled: {class} on {date}" |
| `ClassReminder24h` | 24h before session | "Tomorrow: {class} at {time}" |
| `ClassReminder1h` | 1h before session | "Starting soon: {class} at {time}" |
| `WaitlistOffer` | Spot opens for waitlisted member | "A spot opened! Claim your place in {class}" |
| `WaitlistExpired` | Offer window expires | "Your spot offer has expired" |
| `MembershipRenewal` | 3 days before renewal | "Your membership renews on {date}" |
| `PaymentFailed` | invoice.payment_failed | "Action required: Payment failed" |
| `MembershipCancelled` | Subscription cancelled | "Your membership has been cancelled" |
| `MembershipPaused` | Subscription paused | "Your membership is paused until {date}" |
| `WeeklyDigest` | Every Sunday at 9am | "Your week at Stillwater ✦" |

### 16.2 Email Design System

```
All emails share:
  - Font: System serif stack (email-safe Cormorant fallback)
  - Color: Full Stillwater token set (safe hex values, not CSS vars)
  - Layout: Single-column (600px max), generous padding
  - Footer: Unsubscribe link, studio address (CAN-SPAM / GDPR compliant)
  - Alt text: All images have descriptive alt text
  - Plain text: All emails have a plain text version generated automatically
```

### 16.3 Email Rendering Strategy (React Email v6 + Resend)

> ⚠️ **Paradigm Shift (April 16, 2026):** React Email v6.0.0 unified all component packages (`@react-email/components`, `@react-email/render`, `@react-email/button`, etc.) into a single `react-email` package. All imports must come from the `react-email` root. The v0.x sub-packages are deprecated. See `react_email_suggestion.md` for full analysis (cited in MEP D43).

**Bundle Bloat Risk:** React Email v6.6.0 is 1.8MB (514KB gzipped) and pulls `prismjs`, `marked` (markdown parser), and the full `tailwindcss` compiler into runtime bundles via top-level imports. This threatens Trigger.dev worker CPU budgets (30s for `booking-confirmation`, 30s for `waitlist-promotion` — see §17.1) and Edge middleware bundle limits.

**Rendering Decision (pending ADR-010):**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Resend Native Templates** (zero-runtime rendering) | Zero bundle bloat in workers; 0ms rendering CPU time; leverages Resend's edge network | Requires managing templates in Resend dashboard or CI/CD scripts | ✅ **Recommended** for Trigger.dev workers |
| **B. Local JSX rendering** (`import { render } from 'react-email'`) | Full React component composition; type-safe templates | 1.8MB bundle in every worker cold start; may exhaust CPU budget | Acceptable for Next.js Server Components (not workers) |
| **C. MJML** (via `mjml-react`) | 421KB gzipped (much smaller); reliable cross-client | Loss of native React composition; new syntax to learn | Not recommended — unnecessary migration cost |
| **D. Isolated rendering microservice** | Keeps bloat out of workers + Edge | Adds infrastructure complexity (violates §2.3 "no infra management") | Not recommended |

**Implementation Guidance (Phase 8):**
- `packages/email/src/send.ts` (F8-29) should use `import { render } from 'react-email'` (v6 unified import, NOT `@react-email/render`).
- For Trigger.dev workers (F8-01…F8-12), strongly prefer **Resend Native Templates**: `resend.emails.send({ to, subject, templateId, variables: props })` — this sends a JSON payload to Resend, which handles HTML rendering on its infrastructure.
- For Next.js Server Component email sending (rare — e.g., welcome email on signup), local JSX rendering via `render()` is acceptable since Server Components run on Node.js with no strict CPU budget.
- **ADR-010** (pending) will formally adopt Alternative A for Trigger.dev workers.

## 17. Background Job Architecture

### 17.1 Job Catalog

| Job ID | Trigger | Target CPU Budget | Retries | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| `booking-confirmation` | Booking mutation | 30s | 3 | Send confirmation email |
| `class-reminder-24h` | Scheduled (24h before session) | 30s | 3 | Reminder email + push |
| `class-reminder-1h` | Scheduled (1h before session) | 30s | 3 | Final reminder |
| `class-cancellation-notify` | Session status → cancelled | 60s | 3 | Notify all enrollees |
| `waitlist-promotion` | Enrollment cancelled | 30s | 3 | Offer spot to next in line |
| `waitlist-expiry` | Scheduled (offer expires_at) | 30s | 3 | Expire offer, promote next |
| `membership-credit-grant` | invoice.paid webhook | 30s | 5 | Credit member for new period |
| `membership-expiry-warn` | Scheduled (3 days before renewal) | 30s | 3 | Renewal reminder email |
| `payment-failed-notify` | invoice.payment_failed | 30s | 3 | Payment failure email |
| `weekly-digest` | Cron: Sunday 09:00 local | 120s | 2 | Weekly schedule digest |
| `attendance-summary` | Cron: Daily 23:00 | 60s | 2 | Mark no-shows, update stats |

> ⚠️ **Critical (audit-verified):** The column is labeled "Target CPU Budget" (not "Timeout") because Trigger.dev's `maxDuration` measures **active CPU time**, NOT wall-clock time — time spent waiting on `triggerAndWait` or `wait.for` calls is excluded. Source: `PAD_audit_report-1.md` §"Trigger.dev Retry Config" + `PAD_audit_report-2.md` §C + Trigger.dev docs on max-duration. The `maxDuration` MUST be set in `trigger.config.ts` below (or per-task); if unset, tasks run indefinitely.

### 17.2 Trigger.dev Configuration

```typescript
// services/workers/trigger.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from '@trigger.dev/sdk';  // v4 — root import (NOT /v3 which is deprecated, NOT /v4 which doesn't exist)

export default defineConfig({
  project: 'stillwater-prod',
  runtime: 'node',
  logLevel: 'info',
  // ⚠️ maxDuration measures ACTIVE CPU TIME, not wall-clock time.
  // Time spent on triggerAndWait / wait.for is excluded.
  // Source: PAD_audit_report-1.md §"Trigger.dev Retry Config".
  maxDuration: 120,  // 120s CPU budget — covers the longest job (weekly-digest)
  retries: {
    enabledInDev: false,
    default: {
      maxAttempts: 3,
      minTimeoutInMs: 1000,
      maxTimeoutInMs: 10_000,
      factor: 2,
      randomize: true,
    },
  },

## 19. Performance Architecture

### 19.1 Core Web Vitals Targets

```
Metric    Target    Critical Threshold    Measurement Context
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LCP       < 1.5s    > 4.0s = fail        Mobile, Slow 4G, P75

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 19.3 Image Optimization Strategy

```
All images served through Cloudflare Images:
  1. Upload: Staff uploads via admin UI → Cloudflare Images API
  2. Storage: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, zero egress cost)
  3. Delivery: Cloudflare Images transforms on-the-fly:
       - WebP/AVIF conversion (format negotiation)
       - Responsive sizes (srcset generated automatically)
       - Lazy loading (native + Intersection Observer)
  4. In Next.js:
       - next/image for all images (LCP optimization, CLS prevention)
       - Explicit width/height on all images (no layout shift)
       - priority={true} ONLY on above-fold LCP image
       - Placeholder="blur" with blurDataURL for perceived performance

Image Sizing Conventions:
  Hero images:       1920×1080, AVIF/WebP
  Instructor photos: 600×800 (portrait), AVIF/WebP
  Class thumbnails:  800×600, AVIF/WebP
  Blog hero:         1200×630, AVIF/WebP
  OG images:         1200×630, PNG (generated via @vercel/og)
```

### 19.4 Database Query Optimization

```
Rules:
  1. No N+1 queries — always use Drizzle's 'with' for relations
  2. All list queries paginated (cursor-based for large datasets)
  3. SELECT only needed columns — never SELECT *
  4. Explain Analyze on any query touching > 10,000 rows
  5. Connection pooling via PgBouncer (provided by Neon)
  6. Long-running queries (admin reports) use background jobs

Slow Query Threshold: Log any query > 100ms
Connection Pool Size: max 10 per serverless instance (Neon limit)
```

## 20. Security Architecture

### 20.1 OWASP Top 10 Mitigation Map

| OWASP Risk | Mitigation in Stillwater |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | RBAC at middleware + procedure level; no client-side role trust |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | HTTPS enforced; session tokens encrypted (Better Auth); secrets in env vars only |
| A03: Injection | Drizzle ORM parameterized queries everywhere; no raw SQL string interpolation |
| A04: Insecure Design | Threat model documented; STRIDE analysis for booking + payment flows |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | `.env.example` documents all vars; no defaults in production config |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | Dependabot + `pnpm audit` in CI; weekly automated PRs |
| A07: Auth Failures | Better Auth with secure cookie settings; magic link with expiry; rate limiting on auth endpoints |
| A08: Software Integrity | Stripe signature verification on all webhooks; Sanity webhook secret |
| A09: Logging Failures | All mutations logged in Axiom with userId; payment events in DB audit log |
| A10: SSRF | No user-supplied URLs followed server-side; allowlist for external requests |

### 20.2 Rate Limiting Strategy

```typescript
// Rate limits applied at Edge Middleware (Upstash Redis)

const RATE_LIMITS = {
  // Auth endpoints
  'auth/signin':          { requests: 5,   window: '1m' },
  'auth/magic-link':      { requests: 3,   window: '5m' },

  // Mutations (per authenticated user)
  'bookings.book':        { requests: 10,  window: '1m' },
  'bookings.cancel':      { requests: 10,  window: '1m' },
  'memberships.subscribe':{ requests: 3,   window: '5m' },

  // Public API (per IP)
  'schedule.getWeek':     { requests: 60,  window: '1m' },
  'trpc.*':               { requests: 100, window: '1m' },
} as const;
```

### 20.3 Input Validation Architecture

```
All inputs validated at TWO layers:
  1. Client-side: react-hook-form + Zod resolver (UX feedback, not security)
  2. Server-side: tRPC Zod input schemas (security boundary — never trust client)

Never validate only on the client.
Never trust req.body without Zod parsing.
```

### 20.4 Secret Management

```
Development:  .env.local (gitignored; .env.example committed)
Preview:      Vercel environment variables (per-branch)
Production:   Vercel environment variables (encrypted at rest)

Secret Rotation Policy:
  - Stripe keys: Rotate annually, immediately on suspected compromise
  - Auth secret: Rotate if any infrastructure change
  - Sanity token: Rotate annually
  - Resend API key: Rotate annually

NEVER:
  - Commit secrets to git
  - Log secrets
  - Pass secrets through client-side code
  - Store secrets in database
```

### 20.5 Content Security Policy

## 21. Testing Strategy

### 21.1 TDD Mandate

```
Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY for all business logic.
Exception: Pure styling/layout changes with no logic.

Cycle per unit of work:
  RED   → Write failing test that describes intended behavior
  GREEN → Write minimum code to make test pass
  REFACTOR → Clean without changing behavior
  COMMIT → One atomic commit per cycle
```

### 21.2 Testing Pyramid

```
                    ╔═══════════════╗
                    ║   E2E Tests   ║  ~20 tests
                    ║  (Playwright) ║  Critical user journeys
                    ╠═══════════════╣
                  ╔═══════════════════╗
                  ║ Integration Tests  ║  ~80 tests
                  ║  (Vitest + DB)    ║  Full transaction flows
                  ╠═══════════════════╣
              ╔═══════════════════════════╗
              ║       Unit Tests          ║  ~300 tests
              ║  (Vitest, fast, isolated) ║  Pure business logic
              ╚═══════════════════════════╝
```

### 21.3 Unit Test Coverage Targets

| Package | Target Coverage | Priority Areas |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `packages/api/routers/*` | 90% | Booking logic, waitlist, credit consumption |
| `packages/payments/*` | 95% | Subscription state machine, webhook handlers |
| `packages/db/schema/*` | 80% | Constraints, relationships |
| `apps/web/components/*` | 70% | Interaction behavior, state transitions |
| `services/workers/*` | 85% | Job execution, error paths |

### 21.4 Critical Integration Test Scenarios

```typescript
// Test IDs and descriptions for the integration suite

describe('Booking Flow', () => {
  it('BOOK-001: Books confirmed session for member with active subscription')
  it('BOOK-002: Adds to waitlist when session is at capacity')
  it('BOOK-003: Prevents double-booking same session')
  it('BOOK-004: Consumes one credit from package on booking')
  it('BOOK-005: Rejects booking for member with no active subscription or package')
  it('BOOK-006: Handles concurrent booking attempts via advisory lock')
});

describe('Cancellation & Waitlist', () => {
  it('WAIT-001: Promotes next waitlist member when booking cancelled')
  it('WAIT-002: Sends offer email to promoted member')
  it('WAIT-003: Expires offer and promotes again after window closes')
  it('WAIT-004: Returns credit to member package on cancellation')
  it('WAIT-005: Handles cancellation with no waitlist gracefully')
});

describe('Stripe Webhook Processing', () => {
  it('STRIPE-001: Grants credits on invoice.paid')
  it('STRIPE-002: Marks subscription past_due on invoice.payment_failed')
  it('STRIPE-003: Is idempotent — processing same event twice has no side effect')
  it('STRIPE-004: Rejects webhook with invalid signature')
  it('STRIPE-005: Cancels subscription on customer.subscription.deleted')
});
```

### 21.5 E2E Test Suite (Playwright)

```
Critical flows covered:

ONBOARDING:
  ✓ New visitor → Google sign-in → Member profile created → Dashboard
  ✓ New visitor → Magic link → Member profile created → Dashboard

BOOKING HAPPY PATH:
  ✓ Member → Browse schedule → Select class → Book → Confirmation email

BOOKING EDGE CASES:
  ✓ Full class → Auto-waitlist → Cancellation occurs → Email received → Spot claimed
  ✓ Booking attempt without active membership → Upsell shown

MEMBERSHIP:
  ✓ Select plan → Stripe checkout → Active subscription → Credits granted
  ✓ Cancel subscription → Remains active until period end

ADMIN:
  ✓ Create class → Create session → Publish → Appears in schedule
  ✓ View class roster → Check in member
```

### 21.6 Test Data Strategy

```typescript
// Factory pattern for all test data — never hardcoded fixtures

const getMockMember = (overrides?: Partial<Member>): Member => ({
  id:           crypto.randomUUID(),
  userId:       crypto.randomUUID(),
  displayName:  'Test Member',
  phone:        null,
  joinedAt:     new Date(),
  ...overrides,
});

const getMockSession = (overrides?: Partial<ClassSession>): ClassSession => ({
  id:          crypto.randomUUID(),
  classId:     crypto.randomUUID(),
  instructorId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  startsAt:    new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  endsAt:      new Date(Date.now() + 25.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  status:      'scheduled',
  isVirtual:   false,
  ...overrides,
});
```

## 22. Accessibility Architecture

### 22.1 WCAG AAA Commitment

The Stillwater platform targets **WCAG 2.2 Level AAA** compliance. This is non-negotiable for the yoga studio demographic (35–65 years, high representation of users with visual impairments, motor limitations, and cognitive considerations).

### 22.2 Implementation Standards (WCAG 2.2 Level AAA)

Source: `avant-garde-design-v4/references/04-accessibility-checklist.md` §Level AAA Requirements. Stillwater targets WCAG 2.2 Level AAA (not just AA). The table below covers all 9 criteria applicable to web apps, cross-referenced to `stillwater_SKILL.md` §8.1.

| # | WCAG 2.2 AAA Criterion | Requirement | Stillwater Value |
|---|------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1.4.6 | Contrast (Enhanced) — normal text | 7:1 minimum | All `--color-stone-*` on `--color-sand` verified |
| 1.4.6 | Contrast (Enhanced) — large text (≥ 18pt) | 4.5:1 minimum | All Cormorant display sizes |
| 1.4.8 | Visual Presentation | (a) Width ≤ 80 chars; (b) no justified text; (c) line spacing ≥ 1.5 | `--leading-body: 1.65`; `max-width: 70ch`; `text-align: left` (never `justify`) |
| 1.4.9 | Images of Text (No Exception) | No images of text (logos exempt) | All text is real HTML text |
| 2.2.4 | Interruptions | User can postpone/suppress | Toast notifications dismissible; no auto-redirects |
| 2.3.2 | Three Flashes | ≤ 3 flashes/sec | No flashing animations; reduced-motion respected |
| 2.5.5 | Target Size (Enhanced) | 44×44 CSS px minimum | `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]` on all interactive elements |
| 2.5.7 | Dragging Movements (WCAG 2.2 NEW) | Dragging MUST have click/tap alternative | Booking calendar has click-to-select alternative |
| 3.1.5 | Reading Level | Lower secondary (≈ Grade 8) | Instructional copy only |
| 3.1.6 | Pronunciation | Pronunciation for meaning-dependent words | Japanese term 間 (ma) has `<ruby>` annotation |
| — | Focus indicator (exceeds WCAG) | 3px solid `--color-water-500` + 2px offset | Global `:focus-visible` rule; `--color-clay-300` on dark backgrounds |
| — | Keyboard navigation | Full tab order, no traps | Radix primitives + custom testing |
| — | Screen reader | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels | axe-core + Lighthouse A11y = 100 |
| — | Reduced motion | `0.01ms` durations globally | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block |
| — | Time limits | None without warning + extension | No auto-logout, no countdown timers |

**ADA Title II compliance:** As of April 24, 2026, ADA Title II requires WCAG 2.1 AA for state/local government websites. Stillwater targets AAA (stricter), so AA is implicit. Non-compliance risk: legal action, financial penalties, reputation damage.

**Keyboard Navigation Detail:**
- ✓ All interactive elements reachable via Tab
- ✓ Logical tab order matches visual order
- ✓ Visible focus indicator on ALL elements (3px solid `--color-water-500` + 2px offset)
- ✓ No keyboard traps
- ✓ Skip-to-main-content link as first element
- ✓ Modal focus trapping via Radix Dialog (built-in)

**Screen Reader Detail:**
- ✓ Semantic HTML5 elements (nav, main, article, section, aside)
- ✓ All images have descriptive alt text (or alt="" for decorative)
- ✓ Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- ✓ Error messages linked to inputs via aria-describedby
- ✓ Dynamic content changes announced via aria-live regions
- ✓ Loading states use aria-busy="true"
- ✓ Icon-only buttons have aria-label

**Motion Detail:**
- ✓ prefers-reduced-motion media query respected globally
- ✓ Animated content can be paused (WCAG 2.2.2)

**Cognitive Detail:**
- ✓ Reading level: Grade 8 or below for instructional content
- ✓ Error messages are specific and actionable ("Please enter a valid email address")
- ✓ No time limits on user actions without warning + extension option
- ✓ Consistent navigation across all pages

### 22.3 Accessibility Testing Process

```
Automated (CI):
  - axe-core via @axe-core/playwright in E2E suite
  - Lighthouse Accessibility in CI (target: 100)

Manual (per sprint):
  - Screen reader testing: VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), NVDA (Windows)
  - Keyboard-only navigation walkthrough
  - High contrast mode testing

Per-Component:
  - Every new component in packages/ui has an accessibility test file
  - Tests verify: aria attributes, keyboard interaction, focus management
```

## 23. SEO Architecture

### 23.1 Metadata System

```typescript
// Every page exports generateMetadata() (Next.js App Router)
// Shared defaults from root layout; pages override as needed

// apps/web/app/layout.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL('https://stillwater.studio'),
  title: {
    template: '%s — Stillwater Yoga',
    default:  'Stillwater Yoga Studio',
  },
  description: 'A sanctuary for mindful movement. Book classes online.',
  openGraph: {
    type:        'website',
    locale:      'en_US',
    siteName:    'Stillwater Yoga Studio',
    images: [{ url: '/og-default.png', width: 1200, height: 630 }],
  },
  twitter: { card: 'summary_large_image' },
  robots: { index: true, follow: true },
};
```

### 23.2 Structured Data (JSON-LD)

```typescript
// Injected as <script type="application/ld+json"> in page <head>

// Home page: LocalBusiness
const localBusinessSchema = {
  '@context':   'https://schema.org',
  '@type':      'YogaStudio',             // or SportsActivityLocation
  name:         'Stillwater Yoga Studio',
  address:      { '@type': 'PostalAddress', ... },
  telephone:    '+1-xxx-xxx-xxxx',
  openingHours: ['Mo-Su 06:00-21:00'],
  priceRange:   '$$',
  hasMap:       'https://maps.google.com/...',
};

// Blog posts: Article
// Class pages: Course or Event
// FAQ page: FAQPage
```

### 23.3 OG Image Generation

```typescript
// Generated at build time via @vercel/og
// apps/web/app/og/route.tsx

// Dynamic OG images for:
//   - Class pages:      class name + instructor + level badge
//   - Blog posts:       title + author + publication date
//   - Instructor pages: portrait + name + specialties
//   - Schedule:         upcoming week overview
```

## 24. i18n Architecture

### 24.1 i18n Readiness (v1)

Version 1 ships in **English only**, but the architecture is i18n-ready with zero retrofit cost:

```typescript
// next.config.ts — i18n-ready routing
const config: NextConfig = {
  // When i18n is activated (v2):
  // i18n: {
  //   locales: ['en', 'es', 'fr'],
  //   defaultLocale: 'en',
  // },
};

// All user-facing strings live in /messages/ (next-intl)
// No hardcoded copy in components
// Dates formatted via Intl.DateTimeFormat (locale-aware)
// Numbers formatted via Intl.NumberFormat (locale-aware)
// Currency: Intl.NumberFormat with style: 'currency'
```

### 24.2 i18n Activation Plan (v2)

```
1. Install next-intl
2. Add /messages/{locale}.json for each supported locale
3. Wrap layout in NextIntlClientProvider
4. Replace all string literals with useTranslations() calls
5. Add locale switcher component to nav
6. Configure Hreflang tags in metadata
7. Update Sanity content models to support localized fields
```

### 25.3 Neon Database Branching

```
Production: stillwater-prod (main branch)
  └── Staging: stillwater-staging (develop branch)
       └── PR branches: stillwater-pr-{number} (auto-created/deleted by CI)

Neon branching benefits:
  - PRs get isolated DB copies (copy-on-write, instant)
  - No shared-state test pollution between PRs
  - Migrations tested on branch before merging to staging
  - Branch auto-deletes when PR closes (CI script)
```

## 27. Development Workflow & Conventions

### 27.1 Getting Started (New Engineer Onboarding)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, pnpm 11+, Docker Desktop

# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/org/stillwater.git
cd stillwater
pnpm install

# 2. Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in required values (see Appendix A for local dev values)

# 3. Start local services
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL + Redis

# 4. Initialize database
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed

# 5. Start development
pnpm dev               # Starts all apps via Turborepo

# Verify:
# → http://localhost:3000  (web app)
# → http://localhost:3000/admin  (admin — seeded with owner account)
```

### 27.2 Code Conventions

```typescript
// NAMING
// Components:       PascalCase  (BookingFlow.tsx)
// Files:            PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
// Hooks:            usePrefix   (useSessionAvailability.ts)
// tRPC routers:     camelCase   (bookingsRouter)
// DB tables:        snake_case  (class_sessions)
// CSS variables:    kebab-case  (--color-clay-400)
// Events (PostHog): snake_case  (class_booked)

// TYPESCRIPT
// ✓ interface over type for object shapes
// ✓ type for unions, intersections, mapped types
// ✓ No 'any' — use 'unknown' and narrow
// ✓ Explicit return types ONLY for public API functions
// ✓ Prefer inference over annotation
// ✓ Zod schemas generate types (z.infer<typeof schema>)

// REACT
// ✓ Early returns for guard clauses
// ✓ Single responsibility per component
// ✓ Props interface defined above component
// ✓ No inline object/array creation in JSX (causes re-renders)
// ✓ useMemo/useCallback only with profiler evidence

// IMPORTS ORDER (enforced by ESLint import/order)
// 1. React
// 2. Next.js
// 3. External packages
// 4. Internal packages (@stillwater/*)
// 5. Relative imports
// 6. Types (import type)
```

### 27.3 Git Commit Convention (Conventional Commits)

```
Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

Types:
  feat     New feature
  fix      Bug fix
  docs     Documentation only
  style    Formatting, no logic change
  refactor Code change that neither fixes nor adds feature
  perf     Performance improvement
  test     Adding or updating tests
  chore    Build, tooling, dependencies

Examples:
  feat(bookings): add waitlist auto-promotion on cancellation
  fix(payments): prevent duplicate credit grant on webhook retry
  perf(schedule): add index on class_sessions.starts_at
  test(bookings): add integration test for concurrent booking race
  docs(pad): update data architecture with class_packages entity

Scope: package or feature area (bookings, payments, admin, auth, ui, db)
```

### 27.4 Pull Request Requirements

```
PR Checklist (enforced via PR template):
  □ Tests written (unit + integration for business logic)
  □ All existing tests pass
  □ TypeScript compiles with no errors
  □ Lint passes with no warnings
  □ Accessibility: no new axe-core violations
  □ PAD updated (if architectural change)
  □ ADR added (if architectural decision made)
  □ .env.example updated (if new env var required)
  □ Migration reversible (if DB migration included)
  □ Bundle size within budget
```

## 28. Error Handling Strategy

### 28.1 Error Classification

```
Layer          Error Class            Handling
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
tRPC           TRPCError             Typed codes; client receives structured error
  BAD_REQUEST  → User input invalid  → Field-level error message
  UNAUTHORIZED → Not authenticated   → Redirect to login
  FORBIDDEN    → Insufficient role   → 403 toast + redirect
  NOT_FOUND    → Resource missing    → Empty state or 404 page
  CONFLICT     → Booking collision   → "Class full" or "Already booked" toast
  TOO_MANY_REQUESTS → Rate limited   → "Try again in X seconds" toast
  INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR → Unexpected → Generic error + Sentry capture

Stripe         StripeError           Wrapped in tRPC INTERNAL / BAD_REQUEST
Database       DrizzleError          Caught in tRPC, logged, generic message to user
Jobs           TriggerError          Automatic retry (3 attempts); alert if all fail
Sanity         SanityError           Fallback to cached/default content; log warning
```

### 28.2 Client-Side Error Boundary Strategy

```tsx
// Error boundaries at three levels:

// 1. Global: apps/web/app/global-error.tsx
//    → Catches root layout errors; shows full-page branded error screen

// 2. Page: apps/web/app/error.tsx
//    → Catches page-level errors; shows error within shell (nav preserved)

// 3. Component: <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ComponentError />}>
//    → Wraps independent widgets; shows inline error without breaking page
//    → Always includes: error description + retry button + report link
```

### 28.3 User-Facing Error Messages

```
Principle: Never expose technical errors to users.
           Always provide: what happened + what to do next.

Error                          User Message
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session booking failed         "We couldn't complete your booking.
                                Please try again or contact us."
Payment processing failed      "Your payment couldn't be processed.
                                Please check your card details."
Class is fully booked          "This class is full — join the waitlist
                                and we'll notify you if a spot opens."
Already enrolled               "You're already booked into this class."
Membership required            "An active membership is needed to book.
                                View our membership options."
Session expired                "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
Rate limit exceeded            "Too many requests. Please wait a moment."
Unknown error                  "Something unexpected happened. We've been
                                notified and are looking into it."
```

## 29. Architecture Decision Records

> ADRs document **why** a decision was made, not just what was decided. This is the institutional memory of the architecture.

---

### ADR-001: Turborepo Monorepo over Independent Repositories

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The system has multiple concerns (web app, shared UI, DB layer, API, background jobs, email templates) that share types and business logic. The choice is between a monorepo (all in one repo) and a polyrepo (each concern in its own repo).

**Decision:** Turborepo monorepo with pnpm workspaces.

**Rationale:**
- Type changes in `packages/db` immediately propagate to `packages/api` and `apps/web` — no versioning coordination.
- Single PR can span multiple packages atomically.
- Turborepo's task caching makes builds as fast as separate repos in CI.
- Onboarding is a single `git clone` + `pnpm install`.

**Trade-offs:**
- CI times can grow; mitigated by Turborepo caching.
- All packages on same release cycle; acceptable for a single-studio app.
- Requires careful dep graph management; enforced by Turborepo boundaries.

**Rejected:** Polyrepo (npm package versioning overhead for a single-team project).

---

### ADR-002: tRPC over REST API Routes

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a data-fetching layer between Next.js server/client components and the database. Options: REST API routes, GraphQL, tRPC.

**Decision:** tRPC v11.

**Rationale:**
- End-to-end TypeScript type safety from DB schema to UI component with zero code generation.
- Native React Query integration for server state management.
- Server Components can call procedures directly without HTTP overhead.
- Input validation with Zod at the API boundary by default.

**Trade-offs:**
- tRPC is TypeScript-only; no non-TS consumers possible. Acceptable since the entire stack is TypeScript.
- Less familiar to engineers from REST backgrounds; mitigated by documentation and onboarding.

**Rejected:** REST (no type safety bridge without openapi-typescript + code gen). GraphQL (overkill for this data access pattern; additional complexity without benefit).

### ADR-003: Drizzle ORM over Prisma

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL.

**Decision:** Drizzle ORM.

**Rationale:**
- Schema defined in TypeScript; no separate `.prisma` file language.
- No code generation step required; types are inferred directly.
- Better performance (lighter query builder).
- Excellent PostgreSQL feature support (advisory locks, JSONB, CTEs).
- Direct SQL escape hatch without losing type safety.

**Trade-offs:**
- Smaller ecosystem and community than Prisma.
- Less documentation; mitigated by clear, self-documenting schema files.
- No Prisma Studio equivalent; use Drizzle Studio (improving rapidly).

**Rejected:** Prisma (requires code generation; slower; separate schema language; migration experience less flexible).

### ADR-004: PostgreSQL Advisory Locks for Booking Concurrency

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Multiple users may attempt to book the last available spot in a class simultaneously. Need to prevent overbooking without sacrificing performance.

**Decision:** Use `pg_advisory_xact_lock()` within a database transaction, keyed on the session ID hash.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents race conditions at the database level — no application-level coordination needed.
- Lock is automatically released at transaction end.
- No external locking infrastructure (Redis distributed lock) required.
- Scales appropriately for the expected concurrency (yoga studio, not e-commerce).

**Trade-offs:**
- Lock contention on extremely popular sessions (50+ simultaneous bookings). Acceptable for this domain.
- Advisory locks are not visible in standard monitoring; must be added to observability.

**Rejected:** Optimistic locking with version columns (still allows overbooking under true concurrency). Redis distributed lock (adds external dependency for a problem solvable within the DB).

---

### ADR-005: Sanity CMS for Marketing Content Only

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Studio owners need to update marketing content (copy, blog, bios, FAQs) without engineering involvement. Studio operational data (schedules, bookings) must remain in the application database.

**Decision:** Sanity v3 for marketing content; PostgreSQL for all operational data.

**Rationale:**
- Clear boundary prevents content editors from accidentally modifying operational data.
- Sanity's GROQ query language is expressive and fast.
- Webhook-triggered ISR revalidation keeps content fresh without full rebuilds.
- Content schema versioning in code (Sanity schemas as TypeScript).

**Trade-offs:**
- Engineers must maintain two data stores and understand two query languages.
- Instructor data duplicated (marketing bio in Sanity; operational record in Postgres). Managed by using instructor slug as the join key.

**Rejected:** Payload CMS (self-hosted, operational burden). MDX files (requires engineer for any content change). Single DB for everything (content editors would have direct access to operational tables — unacceptable).

---

### ADR-006: Server-Sent Events over WebSockets for Seat Availability

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The booking page needs to show live seat counts that update as other users book or cancel.

**Decision:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) via Next.js Streaming API.

**Rationale:**
- Seat availability is a **server → client only** data flow; WebSockets' bidirectional capability is unnecessary.
- SSE works over standard HTTP/2 — no protocol upgrade, no separate server.
- Vercel Serverless Functions support streaming responses.
- Simpler implementation and lower operational overhead than WebSockets.

**Trade-offs:**
- SSE connections have a 6-connection limit in HTTP/1.1 (per browser, per domain). Mitigated by HTTP/2 (multiplexed).
- SSE reconnects automatically on disconnect, but polling interval (10s) means brief staleness. Acceptable.

**Rejected:** WebSockets (overkill; separate infrastructure on Vercel; bidirectionality not needed). Long polling (higher server load; more complex). Pusher/Ably (cost; external dependency for a solved problem).

---

### ADR-007: Trigger.dev for Background Jobs over BullMQ

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Multiple async side effects (emails, waitlist promotion, reminders) cannot run in serverless functions due to timeout constraints.

**Decision:** Trigger.dev v4 (cloud-hosted). v3 is deprecated — new v3 deploys stop working April 1, 2026. v4 reached GA August 2025.

**Rationale:**
- Durable execution with automatic retries and exponential backoff.
- Scheduled jobs (cron) built in.
- Full job run history and debugging UI.
- No infrastructure to manage (Redis, workers).
- Generous free tier for small studio volume.

**Trade-offs:**
- Vendor dependency; mitigated by wrapping in a thin abstraction layer.
- Job code must be deployed separately from the web app.

**Rejected:** BullMQ (requires self-managed Redis + worker processes; significant ops overhead). Inngest (similar capability; Trigger.dev has better TypeScript DX). Next.js API routes (10s timeout; not suitable for async work).

---

### ADR-008: Better Auth over Auth.js v5

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** Accepted (validated against `guide_auth-v5_vs_better-auth.md` July 2026)

**Context:** Authentication library choice for the Stillwater platform. Auth.js v5 (formerly NextAuth) has been the de facto Next.js auth library, but its v5 rewrite has been in beta for over a year (5.0.0-beta.31 as of July 2026) and has never left the beta channel since the rewrite began. The npm "latest" tag still points to legacy v4.24.14. In September 2025, the Better Auth team took over Auth.js maintenance and now also patches security issues for Auth.js. Auth.js's own guidance for new projects now points to Better Auth. Better Auth is at stable v1.6.23 with v1.7.0-beta in testing, and is documented as "fully compatible with Next.js 16."

**Decision:** Better Auth v1.6.23 (replaces Auth.js v5).

**Rationale:**
- Stable (non-beta) release line — Auth.js v5 has been beta for 18+ months with no stable cut.
- Verified Next.js 16 compatibility (Better Auth docs explicitly state this; Auth.js v5 has open GitHub issues #13302 and #13388 reporting peer-dependency conflicts and server-action configuration failures on Next.js 16).
- Active maintenance by the original Better Auth team, who also now patch Auth.js security issues.
- TypeScript-first, plugin-based architecture with first-class support for RBAC, 2FA, and organizations.
- Drizzle adapter support (same as Auth.js, but with stricter typing).
- Session enrichment via `session.sessionData` callback — attaches `memberId` + `roles` from `role_assignments` table.
- Google OAuth + Magic Link (via Resend) providers built-in.
- Framework-agnostic core with dedicated Next.js adapter — future-proof if Stillwater ever adds a mobile app or separate admin SPA.

**Trade-offs:**
- API surface differs from Auth.js — requires migration learning:
  - `auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })` instead of header-implicit `auth()`.
  - `authClient.signIn.social({ provider: "google" })` instead of `signIn("google")` from `next-auth/react`.
  - `authClient.useSession()` returns `{ data, error, refetch, isPending }` instead of `{ data, status, update }`.
  - Route handler at `/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` instead of `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
  - Handler export: `toNextJsHandler(auth)` instead of `export const { handlers } = NextAuth(...)`.
- Database schema uses stricter typing with renamed fields/tables (User: `emailVerified` boolean not timestamp; Session: `token`/`expiresAt` instead of `sessionToken`/`expires`, adds `ipAddress`/`userAgent`; Account: camelCase, `accountId`/`providerId`; `VerificationToken` → `Verification` with single `id` PK and `value` field).
- 2-layer auth pattern mandated: `proxy.ts` does cookie-existence-only check via `getSessionCookie()`; full session validation + RBAC via `auth.api.getSession()` in Server Component layouts (per Auth0 + Better Auth + Next.js 16 guidance).
- Smaller community than Auth.js (mitigated by active Discord + excellent docs).

**Rejected:** Auth.js v5 (still beta at 5.0.0-beta.31; never left beta since rewrite; Next.js 16 friction per GitHub #13302, #13388; maintenance handover to Better Auth team Sept 2025). Clerk (vendor lock-in, cost, less type safety). NextAuth v4 (legacy, no App Router support). Supertokens (self-hosted complexity).

**Source:** `scaffolding_files.md` preamble (lines 1–9); `guide_auth-v5_vs_better-auth.md` (July 2026 research validation); `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §2 discrepancy D1, D37, D38, D39, D40.

### ADR-009: `proxy.ts` Replaces `middleware.ts` (Next.js 16)

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** Accepted (Next.js 16 platform change)

**Context:** Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` to clarify its role as a network boundary rather than a place for heavy business logic. The exported function must be named `proxy` (not `middleware`). This is a Next.js 16 platform change, not an auth-library decision — it applies regardless of whether Better Auth (ADR-008) or Auth.js is used. Auth0's official Next.js 16 guidance recommends keeping `proxy.ts` lightweight (cookie-existence-only check) and pushing full session validation + RBAC into Server Components/Actions where the stable Node.js runtime is available.

**Decision:** Use `apps/web/proxy.ts` (not `middleware.ts`). Export `proxy` function (not `middleware`).

**Rationale:**
- Next.js 16 network-boundary clarification — `proxy.ts` can run on **Edge or Node.js runtime** (Next.js 16 docs are inconsistent on the default — some say Edge, others say Node.js). Regardless of runtime, cookie-existence-only check via `getSessionCookie()` is fast and runtime-agnostic (no DB access). Full session validation requires Node.js runtime and belongs in Server Component layouts via `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`.
- Official Next.js 16 rename; `middleware.ts` is deprecated and will be removed.
- Aligns with Better Auth's documented "fully compatible with Next.js 16" guidance.
- Enables the 2-layer auth pattern: `proxy.ts` does cookie-only optimistic check via `getSessionCookie()` (Edge-compatible, no DB access); Server Component layouts do full validation via `auth.api.getSession({ headers })` + RBAC via `requireRole()`.
- The 2-layer pattern is the Auth0 + Better Auth + Next.js 16 consensus — proxy.ts is "not intended for full session management or complex authorization" (Auth0).

**Trade-offs:**
- All documentation, tutorials, and Stack Overflow answers referencing `middleware.ts` are now stale — engineers must learn the new pattern.
- The 2-layer pattern requires RBAC enforcement at layout boundaries (`(studio)/layout.tsx`, `(admin)/layout.tsx`, nested revenue/settings layouts) rather than a single middleware check — more files to maintain but better separation of concerns.
- `proxy.ts` can run on Edge or Node.js runtime (Next.js 16 docs inconsistent on default) — the 2-layer pattern exists because calling `auth.api.getSession()` on every request is too expensive regardless of runtime. Full validation + RBAC in Server Component layouts (Node.js runtime) via `requireAuth()` / `requireRole()`.

**Rejected:** Keep `middleware.ts` (deprecated in Next.js 16; will be removed). Use Edge runtime for proxy.ts (Better Auth requires Node.js for `auth.api.getSession()`; cookie-only check is Edge-compatible but full validation is not). Put full auth + RBAC in proxy.ts (violates Auth0 + Better Auth + Next.js 16 guidance; causes DB round-trip on every request; defeats proxy's purpose as lightweight gating layer).

**Source:** `scaffolding_files.md` preamble (lines 1–9); Next.js 16 blog post (`https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16#proxy`); `guide_auth-v5_vs_better-auth.md` §Route Protection Pattern Changes; `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §2 discrepancy D2, D36.

### ADR-010: Resend Native Templates for Trigger.dev Workers (Proposed)

**Status:** Proposed (2026-07-06) — pending formal acceptance before Phase 8 implementation.

**Context:** React Email v6.0.0 (released April 16, 2026) unified all component packages into a single `react-email` package. While this simplifies imports, the v6 bundle is 1.8MB (514KB gzipped) and pulls `prismjs`, `marked` (markdown parser), and the full `tailwindcss` compiler into runtime bundles via top-level imports. See `react_email_suggestion.md` for full analysis.

Trigger.dev workers (ADR-007, §17.1) have strict CPU budgets: 30s for `booking-confirmation`, 30s for `waitlist-promotion`, 120s for `weekly-digest`. Importing a 1.8MB package that initializes a Tailwind compiler and Prism.js on every serverless cold start risks exhausting the CPU budget, causing task timeouts or failures.

Next.js `proxy.ts` (ADR-009) is also at risk — if any server component or module in the proxy's import graph touches `react-email`, the Vercel deployment may fail due to unsupported Node.js APIs or bundle size limits (this applies regardless of whether proxy.ts runs on Edge or Node.js runtime).

**Decision (Proposed):** Adopt **Resend Native Templates** (Alternative A from `react_email_suggestion.md`) for all Trigger.dev worker email sending. Workers send a JSON payload (`templateId` + `variables`) to Resend's API; Resend's infrastructure handles HTML rendering and delivery. This achieves zero bundle bloat in workers and 0ms rendering CPU time.

For Next.js Server Component email sending (rare — e.g., synchronous welcome email on signup), local JSX rendering via `import { render } from 'react-email'` (v6 unified import) is acceptable since Server Components run on Node.js with no strict CPU budget.

**Rationale:**
- Protects Trigger.dev CPU budgets from 1.8MB React Email v6 bundle bloat.
- Leverages Resend's global edge network for HTML rendering.
- Maintains React Email JSX templates in the monorepo (`packages/email/src/templates/`) for type safety and preview server — templates are deployed to Resend via CI/CD script, not imported at runtime in workers.
- Aligns with PAD §2.3 non-goal "no infrastructure management" — Resend handles rendering infra.

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires managing template deployment to Resend (CI/CD script or manual dashboard upload).
- Template changes require a Resend deploy in addition to a code deploy.
- Loses some runtime flexibility (can't dynamically compose templates based on DB state in the worker).

**Rejected:**
- **Local JSX rendering in workers** (`import { render } from 'react-email'`) — risks CPU budget exhaustion on cold starts.
- **MJML** (`mjml-react`) — 421KB gzipped (smaller) but loses native React composition; unnecessary migration cost.
- **Isolated rendering microservice** — adds infrastructure complexity, violates §2.3 "no infra management".

**Source:** `react_email_suggestion.md` §5 Alternative A; MEP D43; PAD §16.3 Email Rendering Strategy.
